## 🚀 Step-by-Step Execution Guide (From Pull to Run)

Follow these steps to get the full 3,200+ book recommendation system running locally:

### 1. Pull the repository and set up environment
First, pull the latest code and create a clean Python virtual environment.
```bash
git pull origin main
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Data Pipeline & ML Training
Process the raw data, generate the TF-IDF vectors, compute cosine similarities, and extract the JSON recommendations. This processes the entire 3,200+ book corpus.
```bash
# Step 1: Clean & merge raw CSV datasets 
# (omitting --skip-enrichment will take ~13 mins to fetch descriptions from Google Books API)
python scripts/preprocess.py --skip-enrichment

# Step 2: Train the ML model and generate recommendations
python scripts/train_model.py

# Step 3: (Optional) Evaluate model metrics and generate charts
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

### 4. Launch the Web App
Start the Flask backend server that serves the beautiful UI and in-memory search APIs:
```bash
python app/app.py
```
Open **http://127.0.0.1:8765** in any browser to explore the massive AI-curated engineering library!

### 5. Run the tests (Optional)
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
# With coverage report:
pytest tests/ -v --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing
```
All **119 tests** should pass (~92% line coverage).

### 5. Explore the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/BookRecommender_EDA_and_Model.ipynb
```
Run cells top-to-bottom after completing step 1–2 above
(`outputs/books_clean.csv` must exist).

## ⚙️ Configuration

**All constants live in `config/settings.py`. Never hard-code paths or hyperparameters in scripts.**

```python
from config.settings import PATHS, MODEL, SCORE

# --- Key tunable constants ---

MODEL.TOP_N = 10000        # Ensure all processed books are retained for the app
MODEL.BAYES_MIN_VOTES = 500  # Bayesian rating threshold

SCORE.WEIGHT_RATING     = 0.60   # Fraction of score from Bayesian average rating
SCORE.WEIGHT_POPULARITY = 0.40   # Fraction of score from log(ratings count)
```

## 🤖 How the ML Works

### Pipeline overview

```
Raw CSV  (merged Goodreads 2,375 + Google Books filtered 918 = 3,293 rows)
   ↓
Preprocessing
  · Clean fields · Fill nulls · Strip blocked CDN image URLs
  · Exact dedup + fuzzy dedup (normalised title key)
  · Domain filter (NON_ENGINEERING_KEYWORDS)
  · Optional: enrich missing descriptions via Google Books API
  · Assign one of 13 categories per book
   ↓
Feature Engineering
  title + author + description  →  TF-IDF  →  8,000-feature sparse vector
  (max_features=8000, ngram_range=(1,2), sublinear_tf=True, min_df=2)
   ↓
Cosine Similarity Matrix
  pairwise cosine for all ~3,233 books  (N×N float64, ~80 MB)
   ↓
Bayesian Hybrid Scoring
  WR = (v/(v+m))×R + (m/(v+m))×C        (m=500 min votes, C=global mean)
  score = 0.60×bayes_norm + 0.40×log(count)_norm
  Re-scaled within top-N so rank-1 = 1.0, rank-N ≈ 0.0
   ↓
Top ~3233 books + top-5 similar books per title
  (category-boosted: same-category books get +0.15 similarity boost)
  (recs restricted to top-500 pool so every "Similar Books" link works)
```

### Category-Boosted Recommendations

When selecting similar books, same-category books receive a +0.15 boost to their
cosine similarity score. This ensures recommendations are topically relevant while
still allowing genuinely similar cross-category matches to surface.

**Result:** Category precision improved from 51.6% → 92.0%.

## 🌐 API Reference

The Flask backend serves the following endpoints on `http://127.0.0.1:8765`:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Serves the web app |
| `/api/books` | GET | All ~3,233 processed books (JSON array) |
| `/api/books?domain=AI` | GET | Books filtered by category |
| `/api/recs` | GET | All recommendations (JSON object: title → [recs]) |
| `/api/search?q=python` | GET | Server-side fuzzy search |
| `/api/health` | GET | System health: book count, categories, cache status |

All data is cached in memory at startup for fast responses.

## 🤝 5. Deployment Recommendations for Collaborators

Your team can utilize the following workflow cleanly:

- **Pull Code from Git:** Ensure all collaborators have the freshest commits reflecting the newly unlocked 3,233 dataset scale.
- **Execute Clean Setup:** `python -m venv venv` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Execute ML Run:** `python scripts/preprocess.py --skip-enrichment` followed by `python scripts/train_model.py`.
- **Boot Flask Server:** `python app/app.py`.

The core architectural base is highly robust. To future-proof the application if the input data expands to 10,000+ rows, consider eventually migrating the frontend to intercept server-side pagination instead of pushing the complete JSON blobs, though current browsers navigate the 3,000 element UI list effortlessly.

> **Python version**: tested on **3.10 – 3.14**.

## 🗺️ Known Limitations

| Issue | Impact | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| 24.5% of books have no description | Lower TF-IDF quality | Run `preprocess.py` without `--skip-enrichment` |
| Open Library covers not always available | ~30–40% show emoji placeholder | Covers fetched dynamically on client-side |
| Cosine similarity matrix is ~80 MB | Loaded fully into RAM | Sparse approximation or ANN index (future) |
| `year=0` for a few undated books | Shows "Classic" badge | ISBN lookup via Google Books API (future) |
